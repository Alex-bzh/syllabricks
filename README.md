# Syllabricks

> What a mess: the syllables have mixed! Are you able to put them back in order?

## Goal

The column on the right side of the window contains a list of syllables. Put together, they form a word. Problem is that they are obviously not in the correct order! Your work is to restore order in this jumble…

## How does it work?

A click on a brick makes the letter appear in the main column. If the syllable is at its right place in the word, it will appear in green (success !); if not, it will appear in red (error…).

You can click anytime on the button *refresh* to erase your attempt and give it a new try. Beware! Reloading the page would trigger the display of a new set of syllables. This feature can be more simply achieved by hitting the *Nouveau mot !* button.

## Coming features

- selecting the number of syllables
- switching between the phonetic representation of the syllable and its orthographic representation
- inserting parasitic syllables
- hiding/showing a brief definition of the word
